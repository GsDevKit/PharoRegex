# PharoRegex
Extract of Regex packages from Pharo 9.0 rowanized for use in GemStone.

The pharo9 branch comprises the Regex packages packages extracted from Pharo with a new
package created to capture Pharo-specific aspects.

The rowanize branch comprises the above plus a new package to capture GemStone-specific aspects,
along with the Rowan artefacts that control what gets loaded under what conditions. This pacakage
was designed for GemStone 3.6.x.


These two branches are permanent. It is possible there will be additional permanent
branches for newer versions of Pharo and of GemStone/S.
